# FOR EXAMPLE:
# 1. other-player-balance: "&7%player%'s balance is: &a%balance%."
#
# CANNOT HANDLE:
# 2. other-player-balance: "&7%player%'s balance is: &a%amount%."
#
# let's say %player% returns BobNameYes and %balance% returns 1000.
#
# Result of both:
# 1. BobNameYes's balance is: 1000.
# 2. BobNameYes's balance is: %amount%.
#
# Placeholders:
#   %player% The player in these situations.
#   %balance% The current balance of the player.
#   %amount% The amount of balance given to/set to/removed from the player.
#   %total% The balance of the player subtracted or added by %amount%
